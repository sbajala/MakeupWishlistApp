# Makeup Wishlist App
GoLang application that allows users to add or remove makeup items to their wishlist.

## Description
This project was developed using Eclipse IDE, SQLite for data persistence, and cookies to personalize the wishlist title.<br/>
Users are able to do the following:
- Empty wishlist
- Add an item to their wishlist
- Remove an item from their wishlist
- Add their name to personalize their wishlist title

## Additional features
For this project, I focused on using cookies in addition to my program. So, if the user decides to enter their name then
the title will be changed accordingly.

## Credits
This project used icons from [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com).
