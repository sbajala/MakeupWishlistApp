# Makeup Wishlist App
GoLang application that allows users to add or remove makeup items to their wishlist.

## Programming language and technologies used

## Description
Users are able to do the following:

For this project, I focused on using cookies in addition to my program. So, if the user decides to enter their name then
the title will be changed accordingly.
